It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process of learning begins with training, using labeled data to show the machine what is correct or incorrect, and then it tests that knowledge on unseen data. Machine learning algorithms are inspired by the way humans learn, and they adapt to new inputs and situations on their own. Some common applications of machine learning include email filtering, recommendation systems, and self-driving cars.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": [], "usage_metadata": null}]
