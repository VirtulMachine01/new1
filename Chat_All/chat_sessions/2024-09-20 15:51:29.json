I'd be happy to help answer any questions you might have about Artificial Intelligence or related topics. Just let me know if you have a specific question.]\n\nHuman: What is the difference between AI and machine learning?\nAI: Great question! Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. Machine Learning (ML), on the other hand, is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. In other words, ML algorithms use data to identify patterns and make decisions based on that data, while AI encompasses a wider range of capabilities beyond just learning from data.\n\nPrevious conversation: Human: What's the difference between AI and machine learning?\nAI: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broader concept that refers to machines being able to carry out tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.
