The process began with understanding current models and datasets, designing a workflow, and experimenting with vision models from Hugging Face and other sources. Fine-tuning FuseCap was then carried out, and the generated captions were tokenized for effective use in subsequent applications. A web API was developed using Flask to interface with the FuseCap model. The project aimed to improve resource efficiency during fine-tuning through techniques like quantization, LoRA, and QLoRA.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "ai", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false, "tool_calls": [], "invalid_tool_calls": [], "usage_metadata": null}]
